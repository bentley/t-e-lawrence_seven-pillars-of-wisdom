			<p><abbr>Mr.</abbr> Geoffrey Dawson persuaded All Souls College to give me leisure, in 1919⁠–⁠1920, to write about the Arab Revolt. Sir Herbert Baker let me live and work in his Westminster houses.</p>
			<p>The book so written passed in 1921 into proof; where it was fortunate in the friends who criticized it. Particularly it owes its thanks to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> and <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Bernard Shaw for countless suggestions of great value and diversity: and for all the present semicolons.</p>
			<p>It does not pretend to be impartial. I was fighting for my hand, upon my own midden. Please take it as a personal narrative piece out of memory. I could not make proper notes: indeed it would have been a breach of my duty to the Arabs if I had picked such flowers while they fought. My superior officers, Wilson, Joyce, Dawnay, Newcombe and Davenport could each tell a like tale. The same is true of Stirling, Young, Lloyd and Maynard: of Buxton and Winterton: of Ross, Stent and Siddons: of Peake, Homby, Scott-Higgins and Garland: of Wordie, Bennett and MacIndoe: of Bassett, Scott, Goslett, Wood and Gray: of Hinde, Spence and Bright: of Brodie and Pascoe, Gilman and Grisenthwaite, Greenhill, Dowsett and Wade: of Henderson, Leeson, Makins and Nunan.</p>
			<p>And there were many other leaders or lonely fighters to whom this self-regardant picture is not fair. It is still less fair, of course, like all war-stories, to the unnamed rank and file: who miss their share of credit, as they must do, until they can write the despatches.</p>
