			<p>Chapters XCVIII to CVI</p>
			<p>Allenby, in rapid embodiment of reliefs from India and Mesopotamia, so surpassed hope that he was able to plan an autumn offensive. The near balance of the forces on each side meant that victory would depend on his subtly deceiving the Turks that their entire danger yet lay beyond the Jordan.</p>
			<p>We might help, by lying quiet for six weeks, feigning a feebleness which should tempt the Turks to attack.</p>
			<p>The Arabs were then to lead off at the critical moment by cutting the railway communications of Palestine.</p>
			<p>Such bluff within bluff called for most accurate timing, since the balance would have been wrecked either by a premature Turkish retreat in Palestine, or by their premature attack against the Arabs beyond Jordan. We borrowed from Allenby some Imperial Camel Corps to lend extra colour to our supposed critical situation; while preparations for Deraa went on with no more check than an untimely show of pique from King Hussein.</p>
